# linkedin-bot / social bots
This is forked from another project called 'linkedin-bot' which was a JS script for automatic invitations to add to the network of contacts. I have modified it for my needs to connect and log the information I need for our CRM to log our touchpoints. I have also recently added one to log who came to our meetups. These type of scripts are used for informational purposes only to teach our teams how to script the browser / mine data.
